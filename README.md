## 🧭 The Core Idea: A Virtuous Cycle of Cleanliness

Most Windows cleaners treat your system like a garbage truck—they haul debris away once a month. This repository reimagines optimization as a *daily ritual*. **Windows-Optimizer** is a modular, rule-based engine that learns your usage patterns and preemptively sweeps digital dust before it accumulates. Think of it as a butler who anticipates messes, not a janitor who cleans them.

## ⚙️ Example Profile Configuration

```ini
[Profile:Gamer]
discord_on_startup = delayed
search_indexing = disabled
game_mode = aggressive
windows_update_p2p = off
telemetry = minimal
temp_files_max_age = 24h

[Profile:Developer]
node_modules_cache = deep_clean
docker_orphan_images = auto_remove
npm_cache = weekly_sweep
git_objects = prune_monthly
vs2019_installer_backups = zap
```

---

## 🖥️ Example Console Invocation

```
Windows-Optimizer.exe --profile gamer --dry-run --verbose
```

Output:
```
[INFO] Profile: Gamer
[INFO] Analyzing 1,247 startup entries...
[WARN] Discord.exe impact: 2.3s boot delay → marking for delayed start
[ACTION] 142MB temp files in C:\Windows\Temp (age > 24h) → ready for removal
[ACTION] 53 orphaned installer caches from Adobe updater → safe to delete
[DRY-RUN] Total recoverable space: 3.7GB | Boot time improvement: 11s estimated
```

## 🔌 OpenAI & Claude API Integration (2026 Edition)

This repository includes an optional **AI Advisor Module** that connects to either:

- **OpenAI GPT-4o** – for deep system behavior analysis
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** – for natural-language optimization suggestions

**How it works:**

1. The tool samples your current system state (running processes, disk fragmentation, startup entropy).
2. Sends a anonymized, compressed report to the chosen API.
3. Returns a human-readable action plan—e.g., “*Your pagefile is 3x too large. Suggest reduce to 4096MB. Your prefetch directory has 847 stale entries.*”

> **Privacy guarantee**: No filenames, user documents, or personally identifiable information is transmitted. The AI only sees file sizes, registry key categories, and service names.

**Setup example** (inside `config.ini`):
```
[ai_advisor]
provider = claude
api_key = your_key_here
auto_apply_safe = false
report_language = en
```

---

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

The interface and report engine are localizable via INI files. Currently supported:

| Language | Code | Coverage |
|----------|------|----------|
| English | `en` | 100% |
| German | `de` | 92% |
| Japanese | `ja` | 88% |
| Spanish | `es` | 95% |
| Brazilian Portuguese | `pt-BR` | 90% |

> *To add a new language, duplicate `lang/en.ini` and translate the keys.* Contributions are welcome.

## 📱 Responsive UI & 24/7 Customer Support

- **UI Philosophy**: The tool runs three modes: CLI (headless), WPF (desktop), and a lightweight HTTP dashboard (accessible from mobile browser).
- **Responsive Layout**: The dashboard collapses to a single column on 480px screens, with touch-friendly buttons.
- **Support Channel**: A dedicated Discord bridge and email ticketing system is maintained for verified users. Average response time: **< 4 hours** during CET business hours.

---

## 🧪 Why "2026" Matters

This repository will be actively maintained **through December 2026**. Updates include:

- Windows 11 25H2 compatibility patches
- New tweak database entries every quarter
- Crowdsourced junk file signatures (community-contributed)
- Performance benchmark comparisons with previous Windows versions

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**You assume full responsibility** for any changes made by this software. While every tweak, cleanup routine, and profile has been tested across 50+ hardware configurations, we cannot guarantee compatibility with every third-party application, registry customization, or corporate lockdown policy. 

- Always run with `--dry-run` before first execution.
- Create a system restore point manually.
- The AI Advisor module is a *suggestion engine*, not a decision maker.
